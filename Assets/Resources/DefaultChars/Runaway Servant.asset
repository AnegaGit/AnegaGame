  headline: The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.
  description: 'The village you come from was away from world affairs. Since you could
    walk, you served the local nobles almost invisible for everything. Cleaning vegetables,
    weeding or emptying the pots, no work was too dirty for you.

    It would certainly have continued, if not the young third-born of the house was
    after you. You were not guilty, but what does that interest the nobles? The mistress
    has chased you out of the yard with name and shame.

    You accidentally stumbled into a port city and there was this ship. It was as
    good as any other.


    The setting is challenging.

    Although the character is dexterous and agile, the character can not read and
    has virtually no possessions.


    Your health is not exceptional, but you heal fast.

    You have some mana available.


    You are not very strong.'
