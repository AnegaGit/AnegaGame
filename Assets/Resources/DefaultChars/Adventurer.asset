  headline: 'Adventure: the pursuit of life.'
  description: 'You have been running for years. Be it a marriage proposal, a boring
    job or a marauding band of mercenaries.

    Wherever you go, you will find adventure.


    So it was no coincidence that you were embarking on a ship whose destination you
    did not care about.


    For someone who wants to become an outstanding warrior, magician or craftsman
    her setting is not suitable.

    But alone in the wild, no problem. Her strengths are speed and perception. If
    she can not kill, she bypass the monster running.'
