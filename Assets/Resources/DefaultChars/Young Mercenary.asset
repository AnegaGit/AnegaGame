  headline: Scars are like battle wounds - beautiful, in a way. They show what you've
    been through and how strong you are for coming out of it.
  description: 'When it came to tearing out trees, as a child you could already take
    on the men in the village. Later you joined a group of mercenaries. But they were
    not very successful, so you took the opportunity and boarded a ship in the unknown
    new land.


    You are very strong and fit. With a little practice, it is unlikely that a monster
    will be able to handle you.

    If you are out alone in the wilderness, you may not be able to find your way around.

    Magic is revealed to you only in its simplest features.

    In a blacksmith you should work as a henchman to not spoil the valuable pieces
    of work.


    You have managed to preserve your armor and your sword.'
