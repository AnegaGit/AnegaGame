  title: The Singing Well
  bookText: "A tale according to oral tradition written down by the Calida sisters.\r\n\r\n<b>Preamble\r\n</b>\r\nThe
    written book changes our world. Knowledge can be stored unchanged over long terms.
    But in the same time stories told mouth-to-mouth over centuries are not told anymore
    and got lost.\r\n<p>\r\nWe want to ensure that this valuable ancient knowledge
    will not be lost for further generation with this collection of myth and tales.\r\n\r\n<i>Jaka
    und Wilhelma Calida\r\n</i>\r\n<p><b>Once upon a time</b>\r\nas the mountains
    were higher, the ocean deeper and the forest more impenetrable there lived a dwarven
    girl in the mountain.\r\nShe was handy, hard-working and delighted her parents
    with her laughing once they returned from the mine loaded with coal and ore after
    a long working day.<p>She never left the house without her shiny copper helmet
    and everybody called her Little Copperhead.\r\n<p>Following the valley to the
    plains one reach after some time a small foothill from the mountain. At the pass
    over there was a small but valuable mine owned by her grandpa.\r\nHe found one
    day ice and could deliver fresh ice for every brewery all the year. Even in the
    hottest summer days beer never got warm these days but this is another story.\r\n<p>On
    day grandfather became sick and Little Copperhead were send by her mother with
    a pot chicken soup, a bottle of the strongest dwarven beer and a loan of fresh
    bread to the house of the grandfather.\r\nHer mother enjoined Little Copperhead
    to stay on the way and take care before an evil orc who was seen by some of the
    travelling<p>merchants near the road recently.\r\nLittle Copperhead promised to
    be obedient and set out for her way in the morning. She jested with the guards
    at the gate, waved to the farmers on the fields and friendly greeted the fruit
    farmers during their harvest.\r\n<p>At the edge of forest full of flowers she
    met an old grumpy lumberjack. He chopped a tree with an old war axe. She sheered
    him and told him about her quest. The lumberjack said there grew currently much
    more beautiful flowers in the forest.\r\n<p>Little Copperhead collected a bunch
    of flowers for grandfather. She even walked some steps into the forest but never
    became out of view of the busy road. Within half an hour she continued her way,
    her arm full of the most colorful flowers.\r\n<p>The old lumberjack instead was
    vanished meanwhile. He was nobody else than evil orc who consumed a conversion
    potion to waylay travelers.\r\n\r\nThe evil orc hurried on ahead and throw the
    old dwarf in the well without further ado. Then he emptied a bottle of another
    conversion potion and laid into grandfather's bed.\r\n<p>He cleared the lights
    and closed the shutters because his real nature would have been seen for everybody
    in light immediately.\r\n\r\nShortly after Little Copperhead arrived and wondered
    about the extinguished candles.\r\n<p>'Grandpa, should I illuminate the house,
    shouldn't I?' Little Copperhead asked.\r\n\r\n'No but shut the door!' grumpily
    answered the invisible evil orc.\r\n<p>'You sound really ill grandpa. I can fill
    in a mug for you can't I?' says Little Copperhead and went to the bed.\r\n\r\n'I'm
    not thirsty!' muttered the evil orc below the blanket.\r\n<p>'But you wear your
    night cap absolutely unusual grandpa, didn't you?' wonderingly asked Little Copperhead
    since the evil orc had thrown the night cap over his eyes not to get recognized.\r\n\r\nThe
    girl hunkered over the bed and at the very same time the effect of the conversion
    potion ended.\r\n<p>The supposed dwarf became longer and longer and broke the
    bed into pieces, the huge beard became slobbering fangs and the blanket was pushed
    away.\r\nEven before Little Copperhead realized what happened she lay gagged and
    tied like a pocket in a corner of the room.\r\n<p>'I'll get a good price at the
    slave market for you. This night nobody will identify what valuable load I carry
    away.' Happily whispers the evil orc. He took then girls bag, ate the food and
    drunk the beer which she brought for her grandfather.\r\n<p>Meanwhile grandfather
    in the well regained consciousness where he was because he dug that well by himself.
    Unfortunately he could not climb out of the well since the wall was smoothed and
    polished as fine as a dwarf can work only.\r\nBut he could shout. And so he ranted
    and raved like a dwarf only can rant and rave.\r\n<p>A passerby merchant listen
    the voice but thought the well was cursed. He took a way around the settlement
    holding as much distance as possible.\r\n\r\nA farmer wanted to feed his just
    bought cow at the well but pulled the dumbfounded animal away once he hear the
    voices out of the well.\r\n<p>For some hours some more people were scared away
    but even the most eloquent dwarf does not know swearwords and curses forever.
    So grandfather begun singing miner's songs and such songs dwarven know even more
    than swearwords.\r\n<p>In the late afternoon short before sundown the detached
    watch came from the town. The men and women wanted to celebrate the end of the
    work by drinking some beer in a nearby Inn.\r\nThere were a few dwarven in the
    watch as well and the rough voice out of the well sounded like a sweet lovely
    song to them.\r\n<p>Therefor they decided to drink some water from that wonderful
    singing well. You may imagine how big was the surprise as they pulled an dwarf
    instead of a bucket of cold water out of the well.\r\n<p>Their astonishment rose
    again once they opened the door to the house. The evil orc was going to flee with
    his dithering prize.\r\n\r\nSoon he was overwhelmed by the guards. Little Copperhead
    got rescued and there are multiple reports of what happened to the evil orc.\r\n<p>One
    can be sure the guards guided Little Copperhead home and celebrated a huge victory
    party in the Inn that night.\r\nIt is told they were heard all allover in the
    town.\r\n\r\nNobody knows how the evil orc ended.It is said that he sneaks around
    to this day.\r\n"
