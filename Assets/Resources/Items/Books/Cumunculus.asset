  bookText: "A tale according to oral tradition written down by the Calida sisters.\r\n\r\n<b>Preamble\r\n</b>\r\nThe
    written book changes our world. Knowledge can be stored unchanged over long terms.
    But in the same time stories told mouth-to-mouth over centuries are not told anymore
    and got lost.\r\n<p>\r\nWe want to ensure that this valuable ancient knowledge
    will not be lost for further generation with this collection of myth and tales.\r\n\r\n<i>Jaka
    und Wilhelma Calida\r\n</i>\r\n<p><b>Once upon a time</b>\r\nthere was a farmer.
    His wife gave birth to a girl and the child got the name Enchanta from her parents.
    She was like the shine of the sun, sensible and hard working.\r\n\r\nIn school
    her teacher found soon that there were powerful magic talents slumbered in her.<p>But
    since his own arcane capability was at least lousy and he hated women he never
    told anybody about and prohibited the girl to try and sharpen her talent.\r\n\r\nIn
    her ninth year the mother of the girl died and within a year her father married
    again.<p>Her stepmother brought 3 beloved sons with her. The boys got privileged
    in every case. Enchanta was treated as the lowest ancilla only and had to serve
    her stepbrothers all the day long.\r\n\r\nAll three boys showed magic talents
    and the teacher offered to train them if the girl would stayed away from school.\r\n<p>One
    of these days the stepmother said to Enchanta:\r\n'You are old enough to learn
    the real important things of live. You have to know how to cook, wash, sew and
    farm. There is a lot to do and no more time to put your nose in useless books
    anymore.'\r\n<p>Enchanta was sad since the book had shown her a free and open
    world. But without the money she had no right to go to school.\r\n\r\nYears came
    and gone and the nice girl became a young women, nobody took care about. Her simple
    grey coats were always dirty, no matter how much she tried to put them in order.\r\n<p>The
    days where she had to tie up the rooms of her brothers were rays of hope for Enchanta.
    She could have a look into the shool books and dive into the deep of the mysterious
    world of magic.\r\nHer brothers never noticed if one book was away for some days
    since they are more interested into other things than study.<p>But one day her
    largest brother saw her browsing through one of the books he careless throw away.
    He got angry and clubbed her out of the room.\r\n\r\nThat day Enchanta decide
    that never ever anybody should learn how much she understood in the books.\r\n<p>From
    time to time she tried the one or the other she read or heard.\r\n\r\nSoon she
    became better but without a guidance of a mage and combining snapped portions
    only she created extraordinary magic spells and unusual proceedings.\r\nWhile
    washing she found pieces of gems. A piece of amethyst she hided in the brush of
    her broom,<p> a piece of obsidian she pressed into the handle of her basket and
    a piece of topaz into the foot of her spade. That way her daily tools became her
    wands as well.\r\n<p>Her fast rising skill allowed her to summon a helper after
    a short time. Combined out of parts taken from dead farm animals.\r\nCumunculus
    helped her with all work, she were able to do far away from home.\r\nIt was very
    ugly but Enchanta loved her being much, which had carefully to hide before all
    eyes.\r\n<p>Years later her oldest stepbrother became adult and should enlisted
    into the magic academy. A group of mages came to examine the skill and knowledge
    of the boy. Her stepmother sent the young woman into the forest to collect berries
    all the day to be out of the way. But the mages lost their way and met her and
    her Cumunculus.<p>Enchanta showed the right way but the mages recognized Cumunculus
    and tried to investigate him. The beast cried out of pain and the girl went in
    between the men and her being so stop the pain. But the mages ignored Enchanta
    and so she creates a tight wall in between the mages and herself and fled with
    her being.<p>The mages destroyed the walls within minutes but where previously
    was open forest they found a tight brush.\r\n\r\nThey asked a lot but nobody was
    able to say who the unknown mage was.\r\n<p>One year later another group of mages
    came to examine the second stepbrother. Again the men lost their way and found
    Enchanta and Cumunculus. Again they examined the being and didn't stop as he beast
    cried out of pain. The women made a storm and the eyes of the mages filled with
    tears.<p>It took a few minutes to remove the dust from the eyes but the mages
    found an impassable swamp that was not there before.\r\n\r\nThey asked a lot but
    nobody was able to say who the unknown mage was. The smudgy ancilla nobody just
    take into consideration.\r\n<p>In the third year, the mages came to examine the
    third brother.\r\nThis time they were prepared because they couldn't forget the
    power of the unknown mage and so the group lost the way intentionally. Again Enchanta
    showed the men the way. But as the mages asked about her being she remembered
    the pain and tried to flee.<p>The mages tried to freeze her but she broke the
    mana structure. Finally she passed a portal with Cumunculus, As the mages followed
    there was another portal again and again. After the seventh step they were back
    at the origin and couldn\x19t say where they lost the women.\r\n<p>All what the
    mages from the academy had was a basket; a young mage could snatched away during
    the fight. He had seen how Enchanta used the handle as wand. It was found that
    a tiny splint of a sapphire was hidden in the handle and that it needs an extraordinary
    talent to use the handle accordingly. The studied mages decide to find the young
    mage with all means.\r\n<p>There is no secret that it took 3 month to identify
    Enchanta but mages know tricks, a normal person hardly can imagine. But this is
    another story.\r\n<p>To invite Enchanta to study and teach at the academy the
    Archmage himself came with seven famous professors.\r\n\r\nThe women became his
    personal assistant and might have taken his position years later. But she loved
    the freedom of the forest in the same way as the silence of the library and stayed
    independent.\r\n<p>Cumunculus lived thoroughly happy until the end of his live
    at the academy.\r\nThe novices loved him since he willingly helped to carry the
    water and wash clothes, the young mages since he knew where to find each book
    and gladly went to pick it up and the old mages because nobody else was able to
    polish the old beloved wands like he.\r\n\r\n"
