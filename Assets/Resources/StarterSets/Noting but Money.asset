  headline: There is nothing you cannot buy for money.
  description: 'You have sold everything you once owned. Even after the expensive
    crossing a few pieces of gold remained for a new beginning.

    The set contains a decent amount of money, a small backpack and some rugged clothes.

    You can neither fight nor craft and have to buy or scrounge everything you need.
    Be aware with your appearance, it is a simple outfit only.'
