  description: 'You managed to save your bow and some arrows during the crossing but
    nothing more.

    The set contains a decent high quality bow, some arrows, a small backpack and
    some leather clothes.

    There are a few silver left in your purse, barely enought to buy some food. Shooting
    some fish during the passage saved your from starving. Be aware your clothing
    gives you almost no protection.'
